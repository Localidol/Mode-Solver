# Mode-Solver
This is python script of an implementation of a "Full vectorial 2D Mode Solver" for waveguiding structures (see Credits for the original authors). 
It's still some sort of an alpha version, and it does only few things, i.e. solves only one mode and it doesn't solve for any anisotropic material (the algorithm can solve it, but it's not yet implemented). [I will be ready soon!!]
